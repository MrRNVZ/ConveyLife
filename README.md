# ConveyLife
Conway's Game of Life implementation using Tenserflow

You can run the script with one of predefined or your own map of cells as a text file.
`python ConwayLife.py <cellsmapfile.txt>`

To run the script with random map of desired size and number of cells alive, specify three numeric parameters:
`python ConwayLife.py <width> <height> <aliveCellsNumber>`
  
To run the script on completely random map, no parameters should be specified:
`python ConwayLife.py`
